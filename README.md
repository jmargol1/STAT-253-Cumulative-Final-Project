# STAT-253-Cumulative-Final-Project
This is my cumulative final project in my Statistical Machine Learning course from my junior year at Macalester College
I worked on this project alongside fellow classmate Colin Morefield
This project is using a Dataset about the entirity of NBA statistics. The project explores which individual player stats contribute the most to team wins using machine learning methods including quantitative, categorical, and unsipervised learning analyses.
